The approach is performed in a systematic way, including collecting, preprocessing,
characteristic extraction, model education, assessment, facts user set forecasting. ANN
(Artificial neural network) is used and decided solar panel output. The dataset is divided into
collection and filtering data and check their statistics to assess, overall performance using
metrics together with Root Mean absolute errors (RMSE). Actual and Predicted values are
plotted to look at the predicted results and the variations among the different regressorâ€™s
predictions.
The project contributes to the renewable energy field by providing a real-world and
interpretable way to predict solar power generation. The selected decision tree algorithm is
well-known for its ability to capture non-linear relations, and offers a promising path to
accurate predictions. The results of this project have implications for optimizing energy
utilization and grid management, as well as for the promotion of sustainable energy practices
in the future.
